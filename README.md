# Pipeline
A pipeline in a Software Engineering team is a set of automated processes that allow Developers and DevOps professionals to reliably and efficiently compile, build and deploy their code to their production compute platforms. There is no hard and fast rule stating what a pipeline should like like and the tools it must utilise, however the most common components of a pipeline are; build automation/continuous integration, test automation, and deployment automation.

A pipeline generally consists of a set of tools which are normally broken down into the following categories;

1.Source Control
2.Build tools
3.Containerisation
4.Configuration Management
5.Monitoring
